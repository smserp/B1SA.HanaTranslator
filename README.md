B1SA.HanaTranslator
===================

SMS Fork
--------
- The main focus of our changes were easy consumption of the SQL string translation feature as a NuGet package
- This library is based on the [_Query Migration Tool for Microsoft SQL Server to SAP HANA_](https://github.com/B1SA/HanaTranslator-Src), which is marked as being _archived_
  - fork date: `2017-11-10`
  - git revision: `e53f0ecce5fabdac2c5787ae1311437a148552e5`
- Like the original code the changes are licensed under the MIT license as well
  - The referenced ANTLR library & runtime to parse the SQL is licensed under the BSD license

### Changes
- Targeting .NET Standard 2.1
- Removed UI
- Removed the DB connectivity and with it all its references, but also the _CaseFixer_ feature
  - SQL identifiers are not enclosed in double quotes automatically, the correct case is in the responsibility of the library user!
- Repository clean up & streamlining for packaging
- Switch from static file `config.txt` to non-static object configuration
- Use ANTLR packages instead of local references (only the current release candidate supports .NET Standard 2.0)
- Switch to the more unique and origin honouring namespace `B1SA.HanaTranslator`
- Bumped version to `2.1.0`
- And many more small improvements...

### Usage
````csharp
using B1SA.HanaTranslator;

var translator = new Translator(new Config() {
    TranslationComments = true,
    FormatOutput = true
});

var hanaSql = translator.Translate(
    """
    SELECT "Item", ISNULL("Quantity", 0) AS "Quantity" FROM "Table"
    """,
    out string summary,
    out int statements,
    out int errors
);

### Query Migration Tool for Microsoft SQL Server to SAP HANA
The Query Migration Tool for Microsoft SQL Server to SAP HANA is a semi-automatic tool that helps convert most of the data-definition language (DDL) and data-manipulation language (DML).
It will help you to convert structured query language (SQL) in the Microsoft SQL Server database (using T-SQL grammar) to SQL that can be used in the SAP HANAâ„¢ database (using ANSI-SQL grammar).

After the conversion, you must check whether the converted version is correct according to your needs. 

This tool supports most of the official T-SQL grammar, and some well-known and widely-used undocumented feature. For more information about the official T-SQL grammar, see the MSDN Library. 

If SAP HANA does not support certain SQL, this tool will do the following:

* Find equivalents in the SAP HANA database and convert the SQL.
* Delete the SQL in the input file and display relevant comments in the output file.
* Leave the SQL in the input file as it is, for example, the WITH statement.

In order to find out more details please follow the details on the SAP community blog https://blogs.sap.com/2013/04/10/how-to-convert-sql-from-ms-sql-server-to-sap-hana/.
